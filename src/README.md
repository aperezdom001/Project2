Description: 

Describe at a high level what your project is and the motivation for the project (i.e., what problem(s) your projects solves) and includes a screenshot of the application in the browser.

For this project 2, I created an interactive application called StArt (shortened for Start Art). My application allows the user to look at a list of artists and learn more information about them in terms of their type of work, their inspirations, and a little bit about their life. If the user wants to learn about more, there is a another navigation called "Media" that displays a list of articles with links about different subjects related to art and history. 

 Technologies Used: A list of the languages, libraries and frameworks used in your application.

 React was used to create this application and CSS FlexBox was used to design and organize the layout.

 Getting Started/Installation Instructions: This would likely describe how to use the application and the steps to fork, clone and run the application.

 Contribution Guidelines: This section should offer guidance on where and how users can contribute to your code, identify bugs, and propose improvements.
